                <h3>KP oley Kanda</h3>
                <img src="images (2).jfif" width="200" alt="Baseball Bat 1">
                <p>A lot of politicians in Nepal are not good which is why Nepal hasn't developed till now. KP Oli has his flaws but there are far worst politicians in Nepal than him like Baburam Bhattarai or our current PM Prachanda who led a decade old civil war that killed 17000 people, some madhesi morcha leaders as well that are totally pro India. Yes there is intense hatred for KP Oli in some parts of madhesh due to his frankly insensitive and offensive comments, he must improve on that absolutely but when he was PM his govt did increase budget in madhesh. KP Oli himself is from madhesh and hence it will be too simplistic to say he's anti madhesh but he has some problems.

                    Now some others criticize Oli for his “ultra nationalism” and say he's using it to deny minorities in Nepal their rights but i disagree and again it's too simplistic a view. We faced Indian blockade in 2015 and many Nepalis rightly applaud the stand taken by PM Oli by expanding relations with China to diversify its trade among others. I have previously said we need a broad based nationalism in Nepal to incorporate diversity in Nepal and i don't know KP Oli view on this.
                    
                    Other criticism of KP Oli is he talked too much, just told Nepalis to dream but did nothing. Well KP Oli couldn't even be PM for a year and such things can't be done within short period of time.
                    
                    Overall i will say KP Oli has recently gained a lot of support due to his nationalist stances and i will disagree if people say he's the worst politician in Nepal.</p>

                After he turned eighteen in 1970, Oli became a member of his local chapter of a splinter group of the Communist Party of Nepal. He was arrested in the same year for his involvement in subversive politics.

    <p>I’m Nepali but I think you can get them from some store like amazon.com. I’m no the hugest person on guns really. But just to confirm, make sure that the Nepal government allows it and then if they’re legal, use them. But my question is, Why do you need it? Is their a game you wanted to play? But still I don’t know about such topic like this one. Just do this:

        Confirm with the Government of Nepal to check if you can legally own a air soft gun.
        Make sure that your family members approve having an airsoft gun.
        Don’t shoot at anyone. Find a local place where you can shoot guns (Not at people) at woo</p>

                        गर्मीमा तापमान बढ्न थालेपछी एसियाका बिभिन्न ठाँउमा मानिसहरु धेरै तरिकाले गर्मीबाट बच्ने उपाय लगाउन थालेका छन्। चीनका कतिपय ठाँउमा मानिसहरु ओडार भित्रै बस्न थालेका छन् भने भियतनाममा जे पाए त्यहि वस्तुले गर्मी छेक्न थालेका छन्।</p>
